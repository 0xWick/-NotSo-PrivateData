## Nothin is Private on a Public Ledger(Blockchain) duh :triangular_flag_on_post:

## What does private mean?

Function (and variable) visibility modifiers only affect the visisbility of the function - and do not prevent access to their values.

## Accessing private data? :face_exhaling:

When we start writing smart contracts and come across visibility modifiers like public, private, etc. we may think that if you want some variable's value to be readable by the public you need to declare it public, and that private variables cannot be read by anyone but the smart contract itself.

But, Ethereum is a public blockchain. So what does private data even mean?

## Prevention

> NEVER store private information on a public blockchain. No other way around it.
